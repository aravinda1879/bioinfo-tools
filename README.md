# bioinfo-tools
Just a collection of (often poor) scripts to do various bits of bioinformatics stuff I find myself needing to do.

*Disclaimer, not all of these were written by me, they just happen to be useful. Some are based on examples available online and modified. Some are also not actually functional scripts - just little reminders of commands I've used that did something useful (often long one liners I might want again).
